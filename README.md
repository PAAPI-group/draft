# Proposal for a Browser-Based Personal Assistant API

## Abstract
We propose the development of a standardized Browser-Based Personal Assistant API. This API will enable web browsers to act as personal assistants for users, providing a secure and privacy-respecting interface for collecting, storing, and selectively sharing personal information with websites. This will enhance user personalization, privacy, and control while maintaining compliance with global privacy standards.

## Introduction
The modern web thrives on personalization, but current methods of collecting user data often compromise privacy and security. Users have little visibility or control over how their data is collected and shared. A browser-integrated personal assistant, governed by a standardized API, can address these issues by securely storing user data locally and enabling controlled data sharing with websites.

### Goals
- Provide users with a centralized, browser-native personal assistant to manage their data.
- Allow websites to request user information securely and transparently.
- Enhance privacy by storing data locally and minimizing unnecessary sharing.
- Facilitate compliance with global privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

### Use Cases
1. **E-Commerce Personalization**:
   - A shopping website requests user preferences (e.g., clothing size, favorite colors) to tailor product recommendations.
2. **Content Localization**:
   - A news website requests the user’s language and location preferences for localized content delivery.
3. **Autofill and Form Suggestions**:
   - The browser assistant autofills forms with user-consented data such as name, address, or contact details.

## Design Principles
1. **User-Centric Privacy**:
   - Users have full control over what data is shared and with whom.
   - Default settings prioritize privacy.

2. **Transparency**:
   - Clear logs of data requests and sharing activities.
   - Websites must declare why data is being requested.

3. **Security**:
   - Data stored locally with strong encryption.
   - API mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

4. **Interoperability**:
   - Ensure compatibility across major browsers and platforms.

## API Overview
The Browser-Based Personal Assistant API would provide:

### User Data Storage
- Secure storage for personal data within the browser.
- Categories of data: Preferences, Demographics, Location, Contact Information, etc.

### Permission Management
- Granular controls for users to approve or deny specific data requests.
- Option for one-time or persistent permissions.

### Data Request Interface
Websites can request data using the API with the following workflow:
1. **Request Submission**:
   ```javascript
   navigator.personalAssistant.requestData({
       fields: ['language', 'location'],
       purpose: 'Localize content',
   });
   ```

2. **User Prompt**:
   The browser prompts the user to approve or deny the request.

3. **Response Handling**:
   If approved, the browser shares the requested data:
   ```javascript
   {
       language: 'en-US',
       location: 'New York, USA',
   }
   ```

## Security and Privacy
1. **Data Encryption**:
   - All data stored locally is encrypted.
   
2. **Anonymization**:
   - The assistant can anonymize data (e.g., sharing age range instead of exact age).

3. **Compliance**:
   - Built-in mechanisms for GDPR/CCPA compliance, including data access logs and deletion requests.

4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Limit the frequency and scope of data requests to prevent abuse.

## Implementation Considerations
1. **Browser Integration**:
   - Native support in major browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
   
2. **Developer Adoption**:
   - Provide clear documentation and tools for web developers.

3. **Standardization**:
   - Collaborate with W3C to define the API’s scope and standards.

## Conclusion
The Browser-Based Personal Assistant API represents a significant step forward in balancing personalization with privacy. By empowering users to control their data while enabling websites to access it securely and transparently, this API will foster a more trustworthy and user-centric web.

### Next Steps
1. Form a W3C Community Group to refine the proposal.
2. Conduct feasibility studies and prototype development.
3. Engage with browser vendors and web developers for feedback.

### Acknowledgments
We appreciate the efforts of the W3C and its members in fostering an open and interoperable web. This proposal builds upon existing standards and aims to complement ongoing privacy initiatives.
